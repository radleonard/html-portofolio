    Polytechnic of Jakarta in 2019. My major was Mechanical Engineering but 
    focusing on aviation. Then i continued my study for bachelor degree of

    Production Engineer. Our responsibility is to ensure that every aircraft 
    which released from our hangar is well-maintained, airworthy, and safe for
